 ## Overview of Project
This project’s objective is to analyze the housing market sector in King County, USA between May 2014 and May 2015 and create a machine learning model which is able to predict prices and visualizations to provide insights.
 
 ### Why Supervised Machine Learning?
There was a mutual interest within the group to work with a model that could predict results based on previous data. The housing market sector offers a variety of data where advanced regression techniques can be applied.
 
### Data Source
**Name:** House Prices  
**Origin:** Kaggle – Ames Housing dataset (kc_house_data.csv)  
**Publication:** House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle
