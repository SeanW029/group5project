 ### Overview of Project
 
This project’s objective is to analyze the housing market sector in King County, USA between May 2014 and May 2015 and create a machine learning model which is able to predict prices and visualizations to provide insights.
 
 ### Why Supervised Machine Learning?
 
There was a mutual interest within the group to work with a model that could predict results based on previous data. The housing market sector offers a variety of data where advanced regression techniques can be applied.
 
### Data Source

**Name:** House Prices

**Origin:** Kaggle – Ames Housing dataset (kc_house_data.csv)  

**Publication:** House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle  
 
### Database ERD

* House Database Flowchart created with QuickDBD: Raw Data Table:

### Questions that will be answered with the data:
* Predict housing market price 

* Differences of frequencies in sale by season

* **Correlation between:**

  - Property sales frequency and price

  - Property size and price 

  - Year the property was built and price

  - Location and price



### Software:

Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, Tableau and Supervised Machine Learning.
